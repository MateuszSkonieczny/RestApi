# RestApi

This is a simple Rest Api in C# .Net Core using  Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools. 
I created 4 tables using the code first approach and 5 endpoints. It was a reminder for to check if I still know how to write applications in .Net.

#What I learned/reminded
* code first approach
* endpoints
* LINQ
